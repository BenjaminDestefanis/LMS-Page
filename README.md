Steps to Develop the LMS
Step 1: Set Up the Project

Initialize Git Repository:
   git init

Frontend Setup (React):
   npx create-react-app lms-frontend
   cd lms-frontend
   
Backend Setup (Node.js & Express):
   mkdir lms-backend
   cd lms-backend
   npm init -y
   npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors

Step 2: Database Setup (MongoDB)
MongoDB Atlas: Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cloud database.
Local MongoDB: If preferred, install MongoDB locally.
Step 3: Backend Development
Define Models (MongoDB):

Create models for User, Course, Assignment, and Quiz using Mongoose.
User Authentication:

Use bcryptjs to hash passwords.
Implement JWT-based authentication for login and registration.
API Routes:

Set up API routes for user management, course CRUD operations, assignments, and quizzes.
Middleware:

Create authentication middleware to protect routes (e.g., only authenticated users can access certain routes).
Step 4: Frontend Development
React Components:

Build UI components for course management, enrollment, dashboard, and profile.
State Management:

Use Redux or React Context API to handle global state (e.g., user data, enrolled courses, etc.).
API Integration:

Use axios or fetch to connect frontend to backend APIs.
Protected Routes:

Use React Router for navigation and protect routes using authentication checks (e.g., only logged-in users can access certain pages).
Step 5: File Storage (AWS S3 or Alternatives)
Use AWS S3 or a similar service to store and retrieve files (course material, assignments).
Integrate the file upload functionality in the backend and create upload endpoints.
Step 6: Testing
Frontend: Test components using React Testing Library.
Backend: Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test API endpoints.
End-to-End Testing: Use Cypress for testing the entire application flow.
Deployment
Frontend:

Deploy the React app on Vercel or Netlify.
Backend:

Deploy the backend on Heroku, DigitalOcean, or any Node.js hosting service.
Database:

Use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted MongoDB.
